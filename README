# Phimmuno Engine

---

The `phimmuno-security` module is an optional binary for the PhiCode Runtime Engine that provides an API security layer, protecting RESTful interactions by scanning input for potentially dangerous patterns. Using the Aho-Corasick algorithm for high-performance string matching, it detects threats such as code execution (`eval`, `exec`, `compile`), unsafe system calls (`os.system`, `subprocess`), malicious imports or built-ins, file operations, deserialization libraries (`pickle`, `marshal`), and SQL or filesystem attacks (`DROP TABLE`, `rm -rf`, `../`). It operates as a lightweight, stdin-driven filter, returning a success exit code if the content is safe, and a failure exit code if a threat is detected, allowing seamless integration into the PhiCode engineâ€™s request handling pipeline.
